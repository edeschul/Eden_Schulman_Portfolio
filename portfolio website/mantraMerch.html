<h2>Chosen Mantra: <span class="highlight">Inspiration; Not Intimidation</span></h2>
    <p>
        Since the beginning of my education at an art school, I was constantly surrounded by other talented young artists. This was the first time in my life that everyone around me was just as eager and passionate about design and art. 
        It was difficult for me to feel confident in the artwork I created, because I would constantly compare my work with my classmates'<span>&mdash;</span>in all essence, I felt what people like to call "Imposter-Syndrome." I would relay my concerns
        to my mother, expressing how I felt overwhelmed with everyone's creativity and how everything was quite intimidating to me. That was when she gave some really good advice that I continue to tell myself to this day: instead of feeling
        intimidated, turn that feeling into inspiration, and learn from what your peers do and say about your work. Thus, this advice I later refined into a mantra: "inspiration; not intimidation".
